{"tagline":"MailingListStats","name":"Mailingliststats","body":"Mailing List Stats is a command line based tool used to analyze mboxes. It downloads the mboxes in a directory where database will be created. It stores all the information which is contained in a e-mail.\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\n\r\nMLStats needs the following dependencies (either MySQL or PostgresQL):\r\n\r\nMySQL:\r\n* python-mysqldb\r\n* mysql-server\r\nPostgresql:\r\n* psycopg2\r\n* postgresql-server (it has been tested with 8.4)\r\n\r\n## Install\r\nYou can install MLStats running setup.py script:\r\n\r\n`\r\n    # python setup.py install\r\n`\r\n\r\nIf you don't have root privileges, use the --prefix option to indicate the directory where mlstats will be installed. For more details, take a look at the help of the installer:\r\n\r\n`\r\n    $ python setup.py install --help\r\n`\r\n\r\nYou are ready to use mlstats\r\n\r\n## Running mlstats\r\n\r\nMore options, and a more detailed info about the options, can be learnt by running \"mlstats --help\"\r\n\r\nThe backend postgres requires the database already exists. The creation of tables must be done manually. There is a SQL script with the schema in db/data_model_pg.sql that can be used for this purpose.\r\n\r\n## Analysis\r\n[To be written]\r\n\r\n## Credits\r\n\r\nMLStats has been developed by the GSyC/LibreSoft group at the Universidad Rey Juan Carlos in Mostoles, near Madrid (Spain). It is part of a wider research on libre software engineering, aimed to gain\r\nknowledge on how libre software is developed and maintained.\r\n\r\n## Help and bug reports\r\n--------------------\r\n\r\nPlease write to the developers mailing at\r\n\r\n  libresoft-tools-devel _at_ lists.morfeo-project.org\r\n\r\nIf you want to receive updates about new versions, and keep in touch with the development team, consider subscribing to the list.
