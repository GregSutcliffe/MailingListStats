    INSTALLATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    You need a mysql user capable of databases creation, an easy way of doing
    this consists in:

        1) Open mysql using root user:
                $ mysql -u root -p
                $ Enter password:   (type your password)

        2) In mysql create a new user and grant privileges to him, in this
           example we will create a user called "operator" with password
           "operator":

            mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* to operator@localhost identified
                   BY 'operator';

        3) Exit of mysql and open "MailingListStat.conf" file:

            Look for "database_user=" key and ensure that "operator" is typed
            after (if your mysql user is "operator")

            Look for "database_password=" key and ensure that "operator" is typed
            after (if your mysql user password is "operator")


        Configuration finished!
