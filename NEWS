Changes since version 0.3.1:

	* Added --web-user and --web-password options to download archives that
          are private, making login in the archives web page. Now the archives
          can be downloaded even if they are private (providing that an account
          to login in the archives page is available).
	* New command line options. All the database options are now with a --db
          prefix. A --quiet, --version options have been added to fulfill the
          requirements of Mission 1.
